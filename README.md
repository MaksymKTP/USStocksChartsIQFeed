Need help setting up stock charts to IQFeed data (API or sockets).
Need to configure:
1) Connect existing charts to IQFeed data using the API or Sockets (when entering the stock ticker in the text box, the stock chart should be displayed according to IQFeed data).
2) Y-axis spacing (maximum and minimum).
3) By clicking on the draw buttons - draw a trend line and a horizontal line (all lines should be saved).
4) Set chart timeframes.
HELP ME PLEASE!
